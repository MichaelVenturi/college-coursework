Structures
Lab #1

A menu-driven program gives the user the option to find statistics about different baseball players.  The program reads from a file and stores the data for ten baseball players, 
including playerâ€™s team, name of player, number of homeruns, batting average, and runs batted in. 
(You can make up your data, or get it online, for example: http://espn.go.com/mlb/statistics ) 
Write a program that declares a struct to store the data for a player.  Declare an array of 10 components to store the data for 10 baseball players. 
The program prints out a menu (in a loop, so this can be done again and again) giving the user a choice to:

print out all users and statistics
print out the statistics for a specific player
print out all data for a specific team
update the data for a particular player (change one of the statistics)

DO ALL WORK IN FUNCTIONS. USE A FUNCTION TO READ THE DATA, A FUNCTION TO PRINT THE MENU, and FUNCTIONS FOR EACH OF THE MENU OPTIONS.


Before the program terminates, give the user the option to store the data in an output file.
