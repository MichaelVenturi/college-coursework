Lab 1 - using the template version of the Bag class (due Wed. Sept. 9)
Imagine you just left a store with a bag of groceries. You are concerned that the fragile items will not survive the trip
home, so when you reach your car, you place those items into their own bag.
Using the template version of the Bag class from Chapter 1 (posted in Resources area of Blackboard) do the
following:
• Create 2 instances of Bag objects, named storeBag and fragileBag, that hold string values to represent grocery
items.
• Add grocery items to storeBag (input from the keyboard is optional).
• Write C++ statements in main that remove all the fragile items (eggs and bread) from storeBag and place them into
fragileBag.
Note: Your code must work for any Bag of groceries and not be dependent on data input from an array.
• Print the contents of both bags using a method named displayBagContents that you added to the Bag class, i.e.
a public member function.
• Add a 2 argument function to main (the parameter list consists of a Bag reference and a string) that removes and
counts all occurrences of the given string from the Bag object. Your function should return the number of items
removed.
• In main print the count returned by the function and the contents of the bag after the function executes using the
displayBagContents member function that you added to the Bag class.
